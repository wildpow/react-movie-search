A React app that searches the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/). Displaying movies title, poster, and year the movies where made. Using React [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and bootstrapped with [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/) and deployed [here](https://wildpow-react-movie-search.surge.sh/).

##### This project is Just for learning new frameworks and completing my goal of 2 hours of coding a day.

## Next Steps

- Better styling while learning something new with either a preprocessor (SASS, Stylus, PostCSS) or framework (Bulma, Ant Design, Grommet).
- Add an animation library like [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/).
- Turn into a TypeScript project.
- Learn a new testing framework (Cypress, React Testing Library).
- New features like displaying more information about movies or viewing trailers on user interaction.
